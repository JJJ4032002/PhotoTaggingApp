## Lessons Learned

While working on this project, I had a lot of ups and downs. I had a lot of fun with it, and I had a lot of frustration with it as well. When working with states in React js, I discovered how crucial immutability is. It was a rewarding experience learning to work with Firebase and dealing with numerous edge circumstances while adding, updating, and deleting data.
